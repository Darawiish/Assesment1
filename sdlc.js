// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

1. Planning
2. Analysis of Requirements
3. Design
4. Implementation
5. Testing & Integration
6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysis of Requirements = "Second step is to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. Also includes defining the resources needed to build the project."
const Design = "Third step is to model the way a software application will work. This includes programming language, architecture, platforms, UI, security, communication etc. Understanding these key concepts of how the app will be built."
const Implementation = "This is the actual writing of the code and programming the application according to the earlier design documents and outlined specifications."
const Testing & Integration = "Next is to test the software, checking for any bugs and glicthes that end users might experience. It's important to test it vigorously before launching any application."
const Maintain = "After launching the application into the market, developers must maintenance the software and handle issues reported by end-users. Also updating the software to resolve new issues."
